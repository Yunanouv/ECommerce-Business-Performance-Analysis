In the past, a company's reach was limited by the number of customers who could physically enter via a store's front doors. E-commerce now allows us to access customers all over the world. The growth of social media and the rise of internet usage have made it easier for e-commerce business owners to reach a wide new mix of customers.  
To support the performance of an e-commerce business, past evaluation and analysis are needed to improve the performance and scope of a business.  

This project will analyze an e-commerce business performance using SQL and data visualization by PowerBI to improve business performance by giving business recommendations at the end.  

## Points to Analyze  
- **Annual Customer Activity Growth**   
- **Annual Product Category Quality**   
- **Annual Payment Type Usage**


## Data Preparation  
The first step to analyze is ensuring the data is ready to be used. A local database was created by PostgreSQL to load the 8 datasets and make a data relationship diagram to ensure integrity within the database. Our datasets in a nutshell can be seen from the diagram below.

From the graph of Average MAU, we can see that active users per year have increased rapidly from 2016 to 2017 and grew constantly until 2018. The same thing goes with total new customers which grew tremendously from under 1k to 52k. We can conclude that new customers have a big impact on active user growth.
