In the past, a company's reach was limited by the number of customers who could physically enter via a store's front doors. E-commerce now allows us to access customers all over the world. The growth of social media and the rise of internet usage have made it easier for e-commerce business owners to reach a wide new mix of customers.  
To support the performance of an e-commerce business, past evaluation and analysis are needed to improve the performance and scope of a business.  

This project will analyze an e-commerce business performance using SQL and data visualization by PowerBI to improve business performance by giving business recommendation at the end.

- **Annual Customer Activity Growth**  : 
- **Annual Product Category Quality**  : 
- **Annual Payment Type Usage**        :
